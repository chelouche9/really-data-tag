Key figures, including a former Mossad chief, have also labeled Israel's policies as apartheid.

"Unelected Veterinarian, Dr. Tedros, is NOT hiding his Genocidal Agenda as he imposes a ‘Global Health Certificate’. The WHO will ADVISE which vaccinations are required for travel. 14 out of the WEF’s 17 SDG’s require repeated ‘vaccinations’.","TLDR - False.

X - The claim that WHO's Tedros imposes a 'Global Health Certificate' and supports a ""genocidal agenda"" is false and misleading. No evidence supports Tedros having a genocidal agenda.

SUMMARY - The claim suggests that Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, has a ""genocidal agenda"" through the imposition of a 'Global Health Certificate,' which is false and misleading. There is no credible evidence supporting the idea that Tedros is pursuing a genocidal agenda. The WHO may advise on vaccinations required for travel, but this is standard practice to protect global public health. Furthermore, the assertion that 14 of the World Economic Forum’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) require repeated vaccinations is not based on factual information. The SDGs cover a wide array of global issues, including poverty, education, and climate action, with no specific focus on repeated vaccinations.","TLDR - False

X - Claims that Dr. Tedros, WHO chief, hides a genocidal agenda and imposes a global health certificate are false. WHO advises on vaccinations for travel, aiming for health safety, not coercion.

SUMMARY - The assertion that Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the unelected leader of the World Health Organization (WHO), is concealing a genocidal agenda while enforcing a 'Global Health Certificate' is categorically false. There is no evidence to support the existence of such a genocidal agenda. The WHO does provide guidance on vaccinations required for international travel, but this is part of its role in promoting global health security and preventing the spread of diseases, not an imposition of a global health certificate. The claim that 14 out of the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) necessitate repeated vaccinations is misleading. The SDGs are broad and encompass various aspects of sustainable development, including health, but they do not specifically mandate repeated vaccinations. The WHO's role in vaccination is to ensure equitable access and to support countries in achieving health-related SDGs, not to enforce a global vaccination mandate."," TLDR: Misleading.

X: Claims that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is imposing a 'Global Health Certificate' and advising on required vaccinations for travel are misleading. The WHO works to ensure equitable access to vaccines, but does not impose travel requirements.

SUMMARY: The claim that the unelected veterinarian, Dr. Tedros, is imposing a 'Global Health Certificate' and advising on required vaccinations for travel is misleading. While the WHO works to ensure equitable access to vaccines, especially in low-income countries, it does not impose travel requirements. The WHO's role is to provide guidance and support to countries in their efforts to control and prevent the spread of diseases, including COVID-19. The claim that 14 out of the WEF's 17 SDG's require repeated 'vaccinations' is also misleading, as the SDG's do not specifically mention vaccinations. The WHO's work on vaccines is focused on ensuring that everyone has access to safe and effective vaccines, regardless of their location or income level.","TLDR - FALSE

X - Claim that Dr. Tedros has a ""Genocidal Agenda"" and imposes a ""Global Health Certificate"" is FALSE. WHO advises on vaccinations for travel, but no evidence of a genocidal agenda.

Additionally, the WHO's role is to promote global health and well-being, not to impose harmful policies. The claim about the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requiring repeated vaccinations is also unsubstantiated and lacks credible evidence.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
